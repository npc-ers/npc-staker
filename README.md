# üèïÔ∏è NPC Orthodoxy Camp

**ü•© Steak your NPC-er for re-education and earn worthless $THING CBDCs**

Welcome to Orthodoxy Camp!  Send your [NPC](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa5ea010a46EaE77bD20EEE754f6D15320358dfD8) to camp, earn [$THING](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2c9084E65D046146d6CFc26Bf45F5b80042b90EB).  Just your usual steaking, right?

Problem is, NPC allegiances are fickle.  NPCs can't stay focused on re-education when they're too busy getting outraged by the most recent post they saw on social media.  We needed to build a liquid staking mechanism for today's attention span.

### The Current Thing

The Current Thing‚Ñ¢ changes very rapidly.  Our DAO votes on this frequently and writes this on-chain through the [$THING token](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa5ea010a46EaE77bD20EEE754f6D15320358dfD8).

Whenever a new Current Thing is announced, our staker assigns a pseudorandom multiplier to each NPC.  Most are very low (1x), but some may be high as 10x.  Here's an example distribution for a collection in one epoch:

![NPC-ers distribution](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fd03a23-ad67-4611-a358-5a1929ad4116_238x304.png)

Due to the fact the NPC multiplier is deterministic by epoch, it‚Äôs possible to collect NPCs which will have a high multiplier to collect more $THING.  This means some NPCs with more common traits may nonetheless see utility for stakers.

One final note for whales ‚Äî you get an additional multiplier based on the square root of the number of NPCs staked, inspired by [Paradigm's Goo](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/09/goo)

Stake one NPC, and the NPC gets the exact multiplier stated on the tin.  Stake 4, and these are doubled.  Stake 9, the multipliers are tripled.  Not bad‚Ä¶

# ESG Compatibility

Knowing that NFTs still kill trees, because NPCs don‚Äôt understand the Merge, we needed a friendly solution so as not to offend their performative gestures towards environmentalism.

For starters, all these functions have been hyper-gas optimized to ensure they run efficiently.

Just in case this is too wealthy for you liberal arts major NPCs, we also came up with the ESG-NPC ‚Äî an ERC-20 wrapper for an NPC which uses way less gas.

Any NPC can be ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù as an ESG-NPC, which carries a one time wrapping cost, but then can be transferred and staked in bulk.  You may unwrap at any time to receive an NFT back, but the unwrapping works on a LIFO system so you may not get your original NPC back.  However, since all NPCs are basically interchangeable, does this matter?

Wait, how do you determine a multiplier for wrapped NPCs?  Each new epoch of ‚ÄúCurrent Thing,‚Äù we average a handful of NPC multipliers and apply this to all wrapped NPCs.  If your NPC multiplier is below this amount, you may be able to obtain a higher multiplier by wrapping your NPC (with the knowledge that you may never see your NPC again).

![esgNPC](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa670a680-4f6c-47fd-b7fd-7e2f244ba37f_1210x478.png)

The benefits of a wrapped NPC, in addition to the environmental gesture, are to promote greater conformity and mass formation psychosis.  The ability to best blend into a crowd and dissolve ones opinions into the collective is truly the highest form of achievement.

## Setup Notes

- Add WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID to your env
- Follow setup instructions for brownie

### Tests
- Run `brownie test --network mainnet-fork`

### Troubleshooting
`Unknown contract address` and/or Brownie does not autofetch Contract sources`

- Replace `Contract("CANT_FIND")` with `Contract.from_explorer(`
